#This program allows to colect data from GPS device such as ublox Neo M8 or , and also calculate the drag coefficient of a vehicle. 
#You have to upload .ino file into your microcontroller and connect it with gps device by Pins 3 and 4 (discription is in the .ino file) after that connect microcontroller 
#to your computer, in device manager find in wich port your device is connected and write only a number in entry field. Finally you can start colecting data by using green button and stop it
#by using red. There is also an option to export your data to Excel, and of course after filling all vehicle information you are able to caalculate Cx of your vevicle.
#Keep in mind that when you want to calculate your vevicle Cx your car should reach about 80kmph, after that you have to switch your gear to neutral and wait for car to stop
#when the car reach about 4kmph you can end your measurements.
