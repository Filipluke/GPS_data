#This software application is designed to facilitate the retrieval of data from GPS devices, including the ublox Neo M8, as well as the computation of a vehicle's drag #coefficient. To begin, the .ino file should be uploaded onto the microcontroller and subsequently connected to the GPS device using Pins 3 and 4, as stipulated in the .ino file. #The microcontroller should then be connected to a computer and the relevant port identified in the device manager. Subsequently, the user should enter the port number in the #designated field to initiate data collection using the green button, and terminate collection using the red button. The program also enables users to export collected data to #Excel, as well as compute the vehicle's Cx coefficient by entering all relevant vehicle information. Note that to accurately calculate the vehicle's Cx coefficient, the vehicle #should achieve a speed of approximately 80kmph before shifting into neutral and waiting for the vehicle to come to a complete stop at around 2kmph.
